this webapp allows a user to:

 Click on Get Started from the navbar.
 Fill out a form (with input validations).
 Upon submission:
   - The form closes.
   - A greeting message appears.
   - Submitted data is added to a table just above the footer.
 All major components (`Form`, `Greet`, `Table`, etc.) are lazy-loaded for faster initial loading.
